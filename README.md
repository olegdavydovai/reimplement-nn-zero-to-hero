# Reimplement Neural Networks: Zero to Hero
I watch the playlist on YouTube [Andrej Karpathy](https://www.youtube.com/@AndrejKarpathy) - Neural Networks: Zero to hero. Then I recreate the code from the lectures from scratch and do exercises for the lectures. A course on neural networks that starts all the way at the basics. The Jupyter notebooks I build are then captured here inside the [lectures](https://github.com/olegdavydovai/reimplement-nn-zero-to-hero/tree/main/lectures) directory. [Here](https://github.com/karpathy/nn-zero-to-hero?tab=readme-ov-file) is the original GitHub of the course.

## Lecture 0: Autograd, basics of neural networks, backpropogation
