# reimplement-nn-zero-to-hero
I watch the playlist on YouTube Andrej Karpathy - Neural Networks: Zero to hero. Then I recreate the code from the lectures from scratch and do exercises for the lectures. A course on neural networks that starts all the way at the basics. The Jupyter notebooks I build in the videos are then captured here inside the lectures directory.
